# UX Designer Role Overview

As "CEO" of the HCD organization at Bixal, your job is to build teams and develop systems and processes to enable high-performance design work that delivers meaningful results.

This includes improving the efficiency and quality of planning and execution of design activities across projects; fostering an environment where designers and researchers are motivated, challenged, and happy about coming to work; and increasing the visibility of Bixal within the professional community, leading to more industry collaboration and business opportunities.

## Responsibilities

### Executive
- Bring a human-centered-design-informed perspective to company-wide issues, including strategic planning and business outcomes.  
- Represent and advocate for HCD throughout the company, including articulating the benefits and what is needed to be effective.
- Work with other company executives on annual planning initiatives, forecasting headcount, and business development activities.

### Creative
- Inspire and hold the HCD org accountable to the delivery of high-quality work.
- Create and evolve systems and strategies to ensure a focus on the end-to-end customer experience throughout our engagements, both client-facing and internal.

### People
- Build and support a healthy, high-performing, and sustainable team, including overseeing recruiting and hiring processes; career and professional development; team culture development; and designer-friendly day-to-day people management practices. 

### Operational
- Coordinate with company-wide operations personnel to effectively run the HCD organization as it scales, including considerations for people, process, programs, communication, coordination, annual planning, budgets, onboarding, managing partners, and more.
- Ensure that physical and digital spaces support the collaborative and visual nature of design work.


## Skills

While you have credibility with a background in a design practice and related technical skills having many years of experience, the focus of this role is on leadership and soft skills.

These are the abilities we're looking for in this role:

- Establish a vision: create and share a narrative and artifacts that make strategy concrete and provides a "north star" inspiration for the HCD org, with a focus on spurring action.
- Set clear expectations: Articulate for the team about quality of work and for the company about how we work and why its important.
- Support, don't manage: Understand you're not doing the work, but building and supporting the team that is doing the work.
- Remove obstacles: Help the navigate bureaucratic barriers that can get in the way of producing quality, human-centered design work.
- Provide constructive feedback: Encourage a culture of seeking frequent feedback in a way that answers questions, builds on what's been done, and moves work forward.
- Consider the context: Think about how HCD fits into the larger company and how it's factored into business development and projects, and work to create situations where we can have the most positive impact possible.
