# On Humans

## Check-Ins

Quick daily check-ins help us stay connected and share ideas as we work across different projects.

- We use [Slack](http://bixaluxdesign.slack.com) for automated daily and weekly check-ins.
- Try to respond in a timely manner (especially the daily ones), so others have time to see responses before heading out for the day.
- Include links to work in progress as much as possible. This gives everyone a sense of what others are working on.

## Communication Expectations

Design requires time to think and make things. Set some reasonable boundaries to encourage this.

- True emergencies are rare. No one’s life is at stake. Do not feel obligated to respond immediately to every request on every communication channel. (And don’t expect immediate responses from others.)
- These are some suggestions for setting reasonable boundaries. They are only suggestions:
    - Set regular times for checking email and chat channels and communicate this to your project teams so they know what to expect. (Disable or quit incoming notifications outside of these time to avoid distractions.)
    - To avoid too much conversation happening in email, try to keep emails to 5 sentences or less. When appropriate, link to a shared document, prototype, or other artifact and have conversation around that.
- We have the concept of “flex time” at Bixal, which means we don’t all have to work during the same core hours. That said, you are not expected to be “always on,” working and communicating outside of whatever your “normal business hours” are. (See the Bixal Employee Handbook for more on flex time.)
- Unless it’s really your thing, try to avoid the [sad desk lunch](https://saddesklunch.com/what).
- Ignore presence status indicators. (When you’re not expecting an immediate response, they don’t matter anyway.)

## Design Team Sync-Up

By our powers combined… 

- Every Tuesday, we get together from noon to one.
- It’s preferable to be in the Fairfax office for some face time with the team, but not required.

## Goals, Performance, and Paths

“If you aim at nothing, you’ll hit it every time.”

- On our team, we set goals for ourselves, either by quarter or by year.
- At Bixal, there is a yearly performance review process.
- We haven’t yet defined what career paths look like for us at Bixal. More to come… 

## Location

Most of us work from more than one location over the course of a week. It can be helpful to know where are others are going to be for planning things like meeting and workshops, but try to maintain a “remote-first” mindset and plan accordingly.

- As early as possible at the beginning of the week, post your planned work locations in the Bixal/Admin channel in Teams. 
- If something changes, reply to your original post so it bumps it to the top of list.

## Meetings

Let’s be good stewards of other people’s time.

- Include a goal and agenda on every meeting invite.
- Account for the various ways people may be joining your meeting:
    - Web conference for people on their computers
    - Phone numbers for people on their phones
    - Conference rooms for people co-located
- If you need to make a change to a meeting invite, include a note at the top that describes what you changed so participants receiving the updated invite don’t have to guess.
- Let people know what they can do to prepare for the meeting.
- If there are any links (for example, documents or web conference), make sure they are active so people can click them.
- When scheduling a meeting, first check people’s calendars. Then, unless they’re already expecting to hear from you, check with them directly if they have time. (Don’t assume an open time slot means it’s yours for the taking.)

## One-On-Ones

One-on-ones ensure that you have a dedicated, recurring opportunity to sync-up with your manager.

- This is your time to raise any questions or concerns you have about anything. You control the agenda.
- It’s not necessarily a “what are you working on” check-in, though feel free to raise topics relating to projects and project work.
- If a scheduling conflict comes up, try to reschedule instead of skipping it.

## Working with the Project Team

We value co-create and collaboration, so we try to think about how we can incorporate the whole project team as much as possible. 

- Get visual artifacts into InVision as quickly as possible and encourage feedback there.
    - This obviously includes screens but may also includes things like site maps, task flows, journey maps, service blueprints, etc.
- During meetings and workshops, encourage the creation of artifacts over continuous discussion.
    - This could include shared notes but also things like concept maps, sketches, and journey flows.
- While UX Design happens at the intersection of business goals, user/customer goals, and technical constraints, keep in mind that people in different roles have different responsibilities and concerns. We tend to focus on the user/customers goals piece, but consider others’ perspectives as well.
    - PMs are concerned about keeping clients happy and delivering contracted work on time.
    - Developers are concerned about reducing technical complexity and not running out of time.
