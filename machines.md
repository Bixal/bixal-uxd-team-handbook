# On Machines

## Accounts

Because hackers.

- To reduce security risks, work out of your Standard account for almost everything. Installing and updating software can be done by entering your admin username and password when prompted, even when logged into your Standard account.

## Software Updates

Because updates break things.

- Sketch: wait for x.1 or higher releases to update.
- Microsoft: generally try to update as release become available. (It can’t get worse.)
- Mac OS: keep up with incremental system updates, but let’s talk about major system updates before proceeding.

## Storing, Syncing, and Sharing Work

First, lose no data. (Second, email no attachments.)

- All of our working files should reside in one of our cloud systems (G Suite or Sharepoint).
- For ease of use (and to avoid version control issues), you can sync both cloud systems to your computer so you can work with files directly on your local drive and have them sync in the background.
- To share work, please send links to files in the cloud. Avoid email attachments.

## Tools and Services (Official)

These are the primary tools we use that enable us to more easily share and collaborate on work.

- G Suite: this is primarily used by the Design team for collaboration.
- Sharepoint: this is our quality assurance program system of record.
- Sketch: this is our main design tool.
- InVision Prototype: this is our main prototyping tool.
- InVision Freehand: a digital whiteboard we use for just about anything: capturing inspiration, sketching, making flows, marking up screens, collaborating on ideation sessions, etc.
- InVision Boards: a nice-looking tool for collecting and presenting images, colors, and notes. We use them for things like mood boards and project scrapbooks.
- Miro: a collaboration tool we're starting to use more. More features and capabilities than Freehand.
- Otter.ai: audio transcription tool for user research.

## Tools and Services (Unofficial)

These are some other tools we may use depending on the project team (or personal preference). Free free to try new things, but keep in mind the ability to include others for co-creation.

- [Bixal Sketch Template](https://github.com/pglevy/bixal-sketch-template): a boilerplate file with type, color, grid, and components for new projects in Sketch.
- Trello: collaborative lists.
- Github: collaborative text, code, and other things.
- CodePen: quick frontend prototyping.
- Optimal Workshop: user research tools like card sorting and tree jacking.
- Evernote/Skitch: notes and screenshots.
- Dropbox Paper: notes and documents.
- Webflow: web-based, interactive design, prototyping, and development.
